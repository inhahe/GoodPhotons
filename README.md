# ftrace — a spectral forward + backward photon raytracer

`ftrace` is a physically-based, **spectral** light-transport renderer written in
C++20. Unlike an RGB path tracer, it transports light one **wavelength** at a
time, so dispersion, chromatic aberration, thin-film iridescence, fluorescence
and diffraction all fall out of the physics for free — there is no special-casing
of colour. It has both a **forward** (light-tracing / photon) core and an
independent **backward** (path-traced) reference, a CUDA GPU backend for the
forward pinhole mode, and a small scene-description language (**FTSL**).

---

## Highlights

- **Spectral transport** — single-wavelength photons over a configurable band
  (e.g. `spectral 360 830 1`); per-wavelength refraction gives dispersion and
  chromatic aberration with no extra code.
- **Forward *and* backward** engines that validate each other (mode `V` reports
  the residual between them).
- **Realistic cameras** — from a simple pinhole to a **physical multi-element
  lens** (real glass prescription: depth of field, vignetting, spherical &
  chromatic aberration all emergent), plus fisheye/panoramic projections.
- **Rich material set** — dielectrics with real glass dispersion, metals from
  measured data, rough microfacet, thin-film & multilayer interference,
  diffraction gratings, fluorescence, and stochastic mixes.
- **Wave-optical effects** — thin-film Airy interference, Abelès multilayer
  stacks, and reflective diffraction gratings.
- **Participating media** — one or many coexisting (superposed) fog regions with
  Henyey–Greenstein or Rayleigh scattering; box / sphere / **named-object** bounds
  (fog shaped to a sphere, isosurface field, or mesh AABB) and heterogeneous
  **density fields** (formula-defined blobs with soft edges) via unbiased delta/ratio
  tracking on the forward modes.
- **CUDA GPU backend** for the forward pinhole splat (mode `B`), megakernel or
  wavefront, with CPU fallback.
- **Long-running renders** — time / noise / forever budgets, live ANSI preview,
  and checkpoint/resume.

## Building

Requires a C++20 compiler and CMake. CUDA is **optional** (auto-detected).

```sh
cmake -B build -S .
cmake --build build --config Release --target ftrace
```

The binary lands at `build/bin/ftrace` (`.exe` on Windows).

Useful CMake options:

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| *(CUDA auto-detected)* | If a CUDA toolkit is found, the GPU backend (`src/render_cuda.cu`) is compiled and `-device gpu` becomes available; otherwise a CPU-only binary is built. |
| `-DFTRACE_CUDA_ARCH=native\|all-major\|"75;86;89"` | GPU architectures to target (default `native`). |
| `-DFTRACE_GPU_FP32=ON\|OFF` | GPU transport in float with double film accumulation (default `ON`); `OFF` = full FP64 (slower, CPU-matching). |

## Render modes (`-mode`, or per-camera `mode`)

Modes `A`/`B`/`C`/`P` trace **identical forward physics** and differ only in how
the camera *measures* the light (splat vs. physical catch vs. composite). `R` and
`D` are separate backward / bidirectional estimators. All modes are unbiased and
converge to the same image; they trade **speed, noise character, and which light
paths they can capture at all**.

| Mode | Name | What it does | Backend |
|---|---|---|---|
| `A` | Finite-lens camera | Forward next-event splat through a finite aperture + thin lens (true depth of field, efficient) | CPU + GPU |
| `B` | Pinhole splat *(default)* | Light-tracing splat to a pinhole camera; independent photons | CPU + **GPU** |
| `C` | Finite-aperture catch | Forward photon catch through a thin lens (real depth of field) | CPU + GPU |
| `R` | Backward reference | Backward path-traced reference image; drives the physical-lens camera | CPU + **GPU** |
| `V` | Validate | Runs `B` and `R` and reports the best-fit residual between them | CPU (+GPU forward pass) |
| `P` | Composite | Forward `B` for diffuse/caustic pixels + a backward camera ray for specular/coated surfaces | CPU + **GPU** |
| `D` | BDPT | Bidirectional path tracing with MIS over every light×camera connection | CPU + **GPU** |

### Speed / accuracy / ability tradeoffs

- **`B` — pinhole splat (default, fastest).** Every photon that hits a
  camera-visible surface splats to the pinhole, so essentially no photons are
  wasted — **orders of magnitude faster** than physically catching photons through
  an aperture. GPU-accelerated. *Cost:* a pinhole has no depth of field, and it
  **cannot render specular-first pixels** (a mirror/glass surface seen directly
  splats nothing and stays black — use `P`, `D`, or `R` for those). Best default
  for diffuse and caustic-heavy scenes.
- **`A` — finite-lens camera (efficient depth of field).** A physical finite
  aperture + thin lens + film, but imaged by **next-event splatting** each photon to
  the lens pupil (like `B`'s splat, through a real aperture instead of a pinhole).
  This gives **true thin-lens depth of field and bokeh** at a fraction of `C`'s cost,
  because photons don't have to physically hit the aperture. `B` is the `aperture→0`
  pinhole limit of this camera; rectilinear only (a fisheye needs a wide-angle element
  the single thin lens can't form). Use when you want DoF without `C`'s noise.
- **`C` — finite-aperture catch (brute-force DoF oracle, slow).** Photons must
  physically pass through the aperture to be counted, giving true thin-lens depth of
  field and bokeh — but it is **catch-starved** (most photons miss the aperture), so
  it is **much noisier / slower** than `A`/`B` for the same photon budget. Mainly the
  ground-truth `A` is validated against; use directly only when you want the
  unapproximated forward-catch.
- **`R` — backward reference (unbiased, general).** Traces from the camera, so it
  renders **any** first-hit surface including specular, and is the **quiet, reliable
  reference** for camera-visible lighting. It also renders **fluorescence** — the
  backward tracer is bispectral, sampling a separate excitation wavelength and
  reradiating with the material's emission colour (so `V` can validate the forward
  fluorescent tracer). GPU-accelerated (its own backward megakernel, which also drives
  the **physical multi-element lens** camera on the GPU). It gets **noisy on caustics**
  (light focused through glass/water is hard to find backward). *GPU scope:* the
  megakernel covers area/sphere/cylinder Lambertian lights and all the
  specular/textured materials; scenes using fog, environment lights, spot/collimated
  lights, or fluorescence fall back to the CPU tracer automatically.
- **`V` — validate.** Runs `B` and `R` and reports their residual; a correctness
  check, not a production renderer (roughly twice the work).
- **`P` — composite (fills in what `B` misses).** Uses fast forward `B` for
  diffuse-first pixels and caustics, and a backward camera ray for
  specular/coated surfaces that `B` leaves black — a good "best of both" for scenes
  that mix diffuse lighting with mirrors/coatings. Both layers are GPU-accelerated
  (the forward layer via the `B` megakernel, the camera-side via `R`'s backward
  megakernel) when the scene is within the backward-GPU scope; otherwise the
  camera-side layer falls back to the CPU. *Cost:* more expensive than plain `B`;
  there can be a subtle seam between the two layers. With a **physical lens** the
  pinhole-splat forward pass can't form the lens image, so `P` automatically routes
  to the lens-aware BDPT (`D`) — or, if the scene is outside BDPT scope (fog / env /
  spot / fluorescence), falls back to the backward realistic camera (`R`).
- **`D` — BDPT (most general, slowest per sample).** One unbiased estimator that
  traces a light *and* a camera subpath and MIS-combines every connection, so it
  captures **specular-first pixels and diffuse caustics in a single pass** on the
  absolute-radiance scale (no composite seam). GPU-accelerated (its own megakernel).
  It also supports the **physical (realistic) lens on its camera subpath** — the
  camera ray is traced through the real glass while forward light transport keeps its
  caustic efficiency (the light-image splat strategy is disabled, since a multi-element
  lens has no closed-form sensor projection; runs on the CPU **and GPU**). It renders
  **participating media of every kind** — global haze, multiple superposed media,
  box/sphere/object-bounded fog, and **heterogeneous `density`-field blobs** — with volume
  in-scatter vertices, HG-phase connections and transmittance-weighted edges (subpath
  medium vertices placed by delta tracking, connections weighted by ratio-tracking
  transmittance), so fog *inside a glass shell* images correctly here (a case the
  next-event modes leave dark). *Cost:* highest cost per sample, and it **does not support
  fluorescence or spot & env lights** (use `B`/`P` or `R` for those).

The **image-forming modes are all progressive** — the forward camera models
(`A`/`B`/`C`), the backward reference (`R`), and the bidirectional tracer (`D`) each
refine an image whose brightness is fixed while only graininess falls, so they share the
same live progress and budget flags (`-time` / `-noise` / `-forever` / `-preview` /
`-interval`, and periodic crash-safe writes) on **both** the CPU and the GPU. They're all
GPU-eligible too: **`A`/`B`/`C` and the forward pass of `V`** via the forward megakernel,
**`D`** via its own GPU BDPT megakernel, and **`R` (including the physical-lens camera)**
via its own GPU backward megakernel — which the **`P` composite reuses for its camera-side
layer**, so both of `P`'s layers run on the GPU when the scene is within the backward-GPU
scope. Outside that scope `P`'s camera-side layer, and `V`'s backward reference (kept on
the CPU as a stable ground truth), remain CPU-only. `R`/`D` accumulate their sample chunks
in memory only (no disk `-resume`/`-checkpoint`; those stay forward-mode `A`/`B`/`C`), and
the `P` composite is not progressive.

### Backends & performance (`-device`, `-wavefront`)

- **`-device auto` (default, recommended).** Uses the GPU when a supported CUDA
  device is present *and* the render is one it can handle (forward modes
  `A`/`B`/`C` on a non-fluorescent scene, mode `D`'s BDPT megakernel, mode `R`'s
  backward megakernel — including the physical-lens camera — or both layers of the
  mode-`P` composite); otherwise the CPU. Prints its choice.
- **`-device gpu` / `cpu`.** Force the backend. The GPU **falls back to the CPU**
  for the mode-`P` camera-side layer and for `R`/`D` scenes outside their GPU scope
  (env/spot/collimated lights, fluorescence; any fog for `R`), and for
  fluorescent/oversized-mix forward scenes. Mode `D`'s GPU BDPT megakernel renders
  **all** participating media — haze, superposed, bounded, and heterogeneous
  `density`-field fog — directly on the device. Implicit surfaces / `isosurface`, **procedural patterns**, and
  **dielectric translucency** (frosting + Beer–Lambert colored-glass tint) are all
  GPU-accelerated now — the device sphere-traces the same field expressions, runs the
  same pattern VM, and threads the interior-absorption medium through both the forward
  and backward tracers. GPU **BDPT** (mode `D`) still falls back for any pattern-driven
  material *or* frosted/colored glass, whose per-hit BSDF its MIS kernel can't yet
  reproduce. `cpu` is fully deterministic and is used for reference/validation baselines.
- **`-wavefront` vs. the default megakernel** (GPU forward renders only). Both run
  identical, exactly energy-conserving physics. The **megakernel** runs each
  photon's whole path in one thread and is usually fastest on **shallow, uniform
  scenes on a big GPU**. The **wavefront** splits the trace into coherent
  extend/shade passes over a persistent photon pool and wins on **divergent /
  deep-path scenes and smaller GPUs**. Their RNG streams differ, so their images
  match only to within Monte-Carlo noise.

## Cameras

Defined with a `camera "name" { … }` block (or the built-in scene camera).

**Basics:** `eye`, `look_at`, `up`, `fov_y`, `mode`, and a `film { res N M … }`
block. Film size can be a preset **format** — `full-frame`, `aps-c`,
`micro-four-thirds`, `super35`, `medium-format`, `6x6`, `6x7`, `large-format`,
`4x5`, `8x10` — or an explicit `size W H` in millimetres.

**Projections** (`projection …`): `rectilinear` (default perspective),
`equidistant` and `equisolid` fisheye, `stereographic` ("little planet"), and
`orthographic`. These are analytic remaps available in the forward pinhole mode.

**Analytic depth of field:** `aperture`, `focus`, `lens` (focal length, mm),
`fstop`, and `zoom` give a thin-lens camera with a real focus plane and bokeh.
This is the **fast, approximate** option: an ideal paraxial thin lens with a
circular aperture, evaluated analytically, so it runs in the forward modes (`B`
splat / `C` catch) with no per-element ray tracing. It gives correct focus-plane
placement and blur size but **no optical aberrations** (no spherical/chromatic
aberration, distortion, or field curvature) and a perfectly circular bokeh.

**Analytic projections** (fisheye/panoramic/orthographic, above) are likewise a
cheap closed-form remap in the forward pinhole mode — a true wide field of view
with none of the aberration or vignetting a real objective would add.

**Physical (realistic) lens** — `lens { … }`:

A camera can carry a real **lens prescription**: a stack of spherical/planar
glass interfaces plus an aperture stop. The backward tracer samples a film point
and a point on the rear element and traces the ray *through the actual glass*
(per-wavelength Snell refraction), so **depth of field, distortion, spherical &
chromatic aberration, field curvature and vignetting all emerge from the
geometry** — no thin-lens approximation. A physical lens renders in mode `R`
(backward realistic camera) by default, or in mode `D` (BDPT with the lens on the
camera subpath) when you want forward light transport's caustic efficiency through
the glass; mode `P` routes to whichever of those fits the scene.

```ftsl
camera "real" {
    eye 0 0.55 -1.6   look_at 0 0.35 2.4   up 0 1 0
    focus 2.4
    film { res 512 512   format full-frame }
    lens {
        preset achromat   # singlet | biconvex | achromat | doublet | telephoto | wide
        focal 50          # mm
        fstop 2.8
        glass BK7
    }
}
```

- **Presets** are physically derived (lensmaker equation for the singlet, Abbe-number
  power split for the achromatic doublet), so focal length and colour correction are
  correct by construction; render-time dispersion uses real Sellmeier glass indices.
- Or paste an **arbitrary real prescription** as repeated
  `surface <radius_mm> <thickness_mm> <ior> <semi_aperture_mm> [stop]` lines
  (PBRT lens-file convention). See `scenes/realcam.ftsl` for a working demo.

**Analytic vs. simulated — the tradeoff:** the physical lens is the **accurate but
slower** option. It captures real optical behaviour the thin lens cannot
(aberrations, distortion, field curvature, natural vignetting, dispersion-driven
colour fringing, and aperture-shaped bokeh), but it traces every camera ray
through the glass stack, so it is more expensive per sample than the analytic thin
lens. In both mode `R` and mode `D` it **runs on the GPU** (the backward and BDPT
megakernels each refract the camera ray through the glass stack on the device via the
same lens tracer), so within the GPU-supported scope it is still fast. Reach for the
analytic lens/projection when you want speed and a clean ideal image, and the physical
lens when you want a specific real objective's look.

*Current limits:* the lens attaches to the **camera subpath** — mode `R` (backward),
mode `D` (BDPT, keeping forward caustics but with the light-image splat disabled), or
mode `P` (which routes to `D`/`R`). It maps the sensor across the film width, so a
film whose aspect matches the sensor (e.g. `res 360 240` for a 3:2 sensor) covers it
without cropping, while a mismatched aspect crops. It does not model inter-element
flare/ghosting or shaped-iris bokeh. On the GPU it inherits its mode's scope (no
fog/env/spot/fluorescence, and at most 16 lens surfaces); outside that scope it falls
back to the CPU automatically.

## Materials

Declared with `material "name" { type <type> … }`.

| Type | Description | Key parameters |
|---|---|---|
| `diffuse` | Lambertian reflector | `reflect` (spectrum or `texture:<name>`) |
| `translucent` | Two-sided Lambertian (**diffuse transmission** / thin-subsurface look) — light diffuses THROUGH the surface, so a backlit sheet glows softly. Front hemisphere scatters `reflect`, back hemisphere scatters `transmit`; non-specular, so it connects/renders in every mode (A/B/C/R/V/D/P). CPU only. Alias `diffuse_transmit` | `reflect` (spectrum or `texture:<name>`), `transmit` (spectrum); the two are energy-clamped so `reflect+transmit ≤ 1` |
| `dielectric` | Refractive glass with dispersion, optional **frosting** and **colored-glass tint** | `ior` (Sellmeier glass or constant); `roughness` (constant or `pattern:`/`texture:` map) frosts the reflected & transmitted lobes; `absorb` (spectrum, σₐ per metre) tints via Beer–Lambert interior absorption |
| `mirror` | Perfect specular reflector | `reflect` |
| `halfmirror` | Lossless beamsplitter; `reflect` is the reflect probability (default 0.5 = 50/50). A spectral `reflect` gives a wavelength-dependent (dichroic) split | `reflect` |
| `glossy` | Rough microfacet reflector | `reflect`, `roughness` (constant or `texture:<name>` map) |
| `thinfilm` | Single-layer interference (iridescence) | `ior`, `film_ior`, `film_thickness` (nm), `film_thickness_map texture:<name>`, `substrate_k` |
| `multilayer` | N-layer Abelès transfer-matrix stack | `ior`, `substrate_k`, repeated `layer <n> <k> <nm>` |
| `grating` | Reflective diffraction grating | `reflect`, `groove_spacing` (nm), `groove_dir`, `max_order` |
| `fluorescent` | Stokes-shifted fluorescence | `reflect`, `absorb`, `emit`, `yield` |
| `mix` | Stochastic blend of materials | repeated `layer <material> <weight>`; optional `weight_map texture:<name>` **or `weight_map pattern:<name>`** (2-child spatial blend mask — with a pattern this becomes a math-driven *per-point material selection*, see Procedural patterns) |
| `layered` | Physical coat over a weighted body: reflect off the coat with prob R, else enter and pick one body lobe (energy-consistent). CPU only | `coat { reflectance fresnel\|thinfilm\|manual, ior, roughness[/roughness_map], film_ior, film_thickness[/film_thickness_map], specular }` + repeated body `layer <material> <weight>` |

**Whole-material presets** (`preset <name>`) fill a complete `Material` from a name:

- **Metals** (polished glossy lobe, override with `roughness`): `gold`/`Au`,
  `silver`/`Ag`, `copper`/`Cu`, `aluminium`/`aluminum`/`Al`,
  `chromium`/`chrome`/`Cr`, `brass`.
- **Glasses** (dispersive `dielectric`): `glass` (=BK7), plus every `glass:<name>`
  below (`BK7`/`crown`, `SF10`/`flint`, `silica`, `sapphire`, `diamond`, `water`,
  `ice`, `acrylic`, `polycarbonate`).
- **Iridescent / structural colour** (thin-film or multilayer stacks): `soap-bubble`,
  `oil-slick`, `anodized-ti`/`anodized-titanium`, `morpho`, `beetle`/`jewel-beetle`,
  `nacre`/`mother-of-pearl`.

**Translucency (dielectrics).** Beyond perfectly clear glass, a `dielectric` supports
two physically-motivated translucency controls (both compose with dispersion):

- **Frosted glass** — a `roughness` (0..1) puts a microfacet lobe on *both* the
  reflected and the refracted ray, so light scatters as it passes through. It accepts a
  constant, a `texture:<name>` map, or a `pattern:<name>` (so frosting can vary over the
  surface — see `scenes/procedural.ftsl`, whose height-banded glass sphere is clear at
  the bottom and frosted at the top).
- **Colored glass** — an `absorb` spectrum (absorption coefficient σₐ per metre)
  attenuates throughput by `exp(-σₐ(λ)·d)` over each in-glass path segment
  (Beer–Lambert), so thick regions tint more than thin edges. Authored like any
  spectrum (e.g. `absorb gaussian center=470 sigma=60 amp=14` for amber). Interior
  absorption is threaded through all three CPU transport loops (forward, backward,
  BDPT); see `scenes/translucency.ftsl`. *(GPU: forward + backward `R` accelerate both
  frosting and colored-glass tint; mode-`D` BDPT still falls back to the CPU.)*

---

## Spectra (SPDs, reflectances, indices)

Anywhere a spectrum is expected (`spd`, `reflect`, `ior`, …) you can write:

- **`preset:<name>`** — illuminants and light sources:
  - **Blackbody / daylight:** `bb<K>` Planckian (e.g. `bb6500`), `sun`,
    `d65`/`daylight`, `a`/`incandescent`.
  - **LED:** `led` (neutral), `led-warm`, and `led<K>k` phosphor LED at a colour
    temperature (e.g. `led4000k`).
  - **Fluorescent:** `fluorescent`/`cfl` (generic compact-fluorescent model) plus the
    measured CIE F-series `f2`/`cool-white`, `f7`/`daylight-fl`, `f11`/`triphosphor`.
  - **Gas-discharge lamps:** `hps`/`sodium` (high-pressure sodium),
    `lps`/`sodium-low` (low-pressure sodium), `mercury`/`hg` (mercury vapor),
    `metal-halide`/`mh`.
- **`rgb r g b`** — Jakob–Hanika sigmoid upsampling to a reflectance spectrum
  (round-trips under D65).
- **`table { 400:0.05 450:0.12 … }`** — a measured/tabulated spectrum
  (piecewise-linear).
- **`file:<path>`** — load a measured curve (SPD, reflectance, or n(λ)) from an
  external CSV/whitespace data file (`#` comments, a header row, `wavelength_nm,value`
  rows); the runtime ingestion point for the data mirrored under `data/`. E.g.
  `spd file:data/spd/cie_f2.csv` (see `scenes/measured_spd.ftsl`).
- **`glass:<name>`** — dispersive index via Sellmeier: `BK7`/crown, `SF10`/flint,
  `silica`/fused-silica, `sapphire`, `diamond`, plus Cauchy fits for `water`,
  `ice`, `acrylic`/PMMA, `polycarbonate`.
- **`metal:<name>`** — measured metal reflectance: `Au`/`gold`, `Ag`/`silver`,
  `Cu`/`copper`, `Al`/`aluminium`, `Cr`/`chromium`, `brass`.
- **`reflectance:<name>`** — measured natural-material diffuse reflectances:
  `leaf`/`vegetation`, `skin`/`skin-light`, `skin-dark`, `snow`, `soil`/`dirt`,
  `brick`/`red-brick`, `concrete`.
- **`spectrum "name" { … }`** blocks to define and reuse a named SPD.

---

## Lights

`light <subtype> { … }`:

| Subtype | Description | Key parameters |
|---|---|---|
| *(default)* area | Rectangular area light | `origin`, `u`, `v`, `normal`, `spd` |
| `sphere` | Spherical area light | `center`, `radius`, `spd` |
| `cylinder` | Cylindrical tube light | `center`, `axis`, `length`, `radius`, `caps`, `spd` |
| `spot` | Cone spotlight with penumbra | `origin`, `dir`, `inner_angle`, `outer_angle`, `spd` |
| `collimated` | Thin parallel pencil beam | `origin`, `dir`, `spd` |
| `env` | Environment / IBL light | `file` (lat-long HDR) or `spd`, `rotate`, `intensity` |

**Absolute power.** Any non-env light may author a real physical output —
`power <watts>` (radiometric radiant flux) or `lumens <lm>` (photometric luminous
flux, via `Φᵥ = 683·∫spd·V dλ`) — instead of relying on the per-image
auto-exposure. Authoring either on *any* light puts the whole scene in **absolute
mode**: the film is physically linear, the auto-exposure is replaced by a fixed
sensor gain, and `iso`/`shutter`/`exposure` become true absolute stops (doubling
`power` is exactly one stop brighter). See `scenes/absolute.ftsl`.

---

## Geometry

`sphere`, `quad` (parallelogram), `triangle`, and `mesh` (OBJ import, with
`usemtl use_names` for per-face materials and `uv use_mesh` for mesh UVs).
Meshes without their own `vt` coordinates can be textured via a procedural
projection — `mesh { uv planar|spherical|cylindrical [x|y|z] }` synthesizes UVs
at load time from the mesh's world-space bounding box (the optional token is the
projection/up axis, default `y`).
`group { translate … rotate … scale … <children> }` composes transform
hierarchies (baked to world space at load). Everything is accelerated by a BVH.

### Implicit surfaces (`isosurface`)

Besides the explicit primitives above, geometry can be defined *implicitly* as the
zero set of a signed-distance field and rendered by **sphere-tracing** (see
`src/implicit.h`). An `isosurface { material <m>  <one field element> }` block contains
exactly one root **field element**, which is either a **leaf** primitive or a **CSG
combinator** whose children are themselves field elements:

| Leaf | Parameters |
|---|---|
| `sphere` | `center`, `radius` |
| `ellipsoid` | `center`, `radius <rx> <ry> <rz>` (a non-uniformly scaled sphere) |
| `box` | `center`, `size <x> <y> <z>`, `round` (corner-rounding radius, 0 = sharp) |
| `torus` | `major`, `minor` (ring / tube radii; axis = local +y) |
| `cylinder` | `radius`, `height` (axis = local +y) |
| `cone` | `radius` (bottom), `radius2` (top, 0 = pointed), `height` |
| `plane` | `normal`, `offset` |
| `function` | `expr "f(x,y,z)"` — arbitrary formula leaf (see below) |

| Combinator | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `union` / `intersect` / `difference` | hard boolean CSG (min / max / subtract) |
| `smooth_union` / `smooth_intersect` / `smooth_difference` | filleted boolean; blend radius `k` softens the seam |
| `blob` | alias for `smooth_union` — with `k`, children fuse like **metaballs** |

Every element (leaf *or* combinator) may carry its own `translate` / `rotate` / `scale`.
To rotate a leaf **in place**, position it with `translate` (applied outside the
rotation) rather than `center` (applied inside — it would orbit the world origin).
Non-uniform scale is supported (the field stays a valid Lipschitz-1 SDF by de-rating
the step to the smallest axis scale), so an `ellipsoid`, a squashed `box`/`torus`, etc.
all work. Surface normals come from the analytic field gradient. A worked example with
metaballs, drilled CSG, and a tilted torus is in `scenes/implicit.ftsl`. Implicit
surfaces are sphere-traced on **both the CPU and the GPU** (the device port matches the
CPU to Monte-Carlo noise).

#### Arbitrary-formula isosurfaces (`function`)

The analytic leaves above are all built-in signed-distance fields. To render the
surface of an **arbitrary equation** `f(x,y,z) = 0` — a gyroid, a Goursat/heart shape,
any hand-typed formula — use a `function` leaf:

```
isosurface {
    material gold
    function {
        translate 0.5 0.5 0.45           # (optional) place / rotate / scale the field frame
        expr "sin(28*x)*cos(28*y) + sin(28*y)*cos(28*z) + sin(28*z)*cos(28*x)"
    }
    contained_by { min 0.3 0.3 0.25   max 0.7 0.7 0.65 }   # REQUIRED bound box
    max_gradient 48                       # (optional) Lipschitz bound; auto-estimated if omitted

```

The `expr` string is compiled by the **same math VM as procedural patterns** (variables
`x y z` and `r = |p|`, plus `sin cos tan exp log sqrt abs floor fract sign min max pow
atan2 clamp mix smoothstep noise`, and the constant `pi`). Because an arbitrary field is
**not** a signed distance and has no analytic bound, a `function` isosurface **must**
supply a `contained_by { min <x y z>  max <x y z> }` box (the region the surface is
marched inside). Safe sphere-tracing needs a **Lipschitz bound** `L ≥ max|∇f|` so a step
of `|f|/L` never overshoots the first zero crossing; give it explicitly with
`max_gradient`, or omit it and the loader auto-estimates it by sampling `|∇f|` over the
box (padded ×1.3). `accuracy` overrides the march-step floor. A `function` leaf also
composes inside CSG combinators (`union`, `difference`, `blob`, …) like any other leaf.
The worked gyroid example is in `scenes/function.ftsl`; expression isosurfaces run on
**both the CPU and the GPU** (the device evaluates the identical formula VM — an
expression sphere matches the analytic `sphere` leaf to RMSE ≈ 0.15 % on the same
backend).

##### Ray-march strategy (`method`, `refine`)

Any `isosurface` (analytic *or* `function`) chooses how the ray finds the field's first
zero crossing:

| Key | Values | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `method` | `adaptive` (default) / `sample` | how the ray steps toward the surface |
| `samples` | `<n>` | *sample mode only* — number of fixed steps across the container's diagonal (default 256; or size the step with `accuracy`) |
| `refine` | `bisect` (default) / `regula_falsi` | how a bracketed sign change is refined to the root |

- **`adaptive`** steps by `max(|f|/max_gradient, accuracy)` — sphere-tracing for a true
  SDF (`max_gradient = 1`), or a Lipschitz-bounded march for a `function` field. With a
  correct `max_gradient` it **provably cannot skip** the first crossing (across one step
  `f` can change by at most the step size, so it can't dip through zero and back), and it
  slows down only near surfaces. This is the right choice almost always.
- **`sample`** ignores `|f|` and marches by a **fixed** world step (POV-Ray's sampling
  mode). It needs **no** Lipschitz bound, so it's the fallback when `max_gradient` can't be
  trusted (spiky/near-unbounded gradients where the auto-estimate is unreliable) — but a
  feature thinner than one step *between two samples* can be missed, so raise `samples`
  until the surface is clean.
- **`refine`** only changes root-polishing speed, not the result: `bisect` is
  unconditionally robust (linear); `regula_falsi` (secant with the Illinois safeguard)
  converges faster on smooth brackets. Both land on the same root to ~1e-12.

Validated: on a clean surface the `sample` and `adaptive` marchers agree to RMSE ≈ 0.4/255
(CPU) / 0.01/255 (GPU) — same geometry, both backends. `scenes/function.ftsl` uses the
adaptive default; `method sample` + `samples`/`refine` are shown in the scraps test
scenes.

## Textures

`texture "name" { file <path> encoding srgb|linear filter nearest|bilinear wrap
repeat|clamp|mirror }` loads PNG / JPG / HDR / PPM / PFM images; bind one to a
diffuse albedo with `reflect texture:<name>`. Each texel is Jakob–Hanika
upsampled to a reflectance spectrum. UVs come from quad corners, OBJ `vt`
(`uv use_mesh`), a procedural `planar`/`spherical`/`cylindrical` projection, or
per-hit `triplanar` box projection for un-UV'd meshes (see Geometry). Besides
base-colour albedo, a texture can also drive a **scalar** parameter: a grayscale
**roughness map** on `glossy` (`roughness texture:<name>`) or a **film-thickness
map** on `thinfilm` (`film_thickness_map texture:<name>`, a 0..1 profile × the
nominal `film_thickness`). All of these run on both the CPU and GPU forward paths.
A texture can also be an **indexed-spectral palette** — `palette { 0 spectrum:navy
1 spectrum:crimson … }` maps red-channel indices (0..255) to named reflectance
spectra, looked up nearest (CPU only; GPU falls back). A 2-child `mix` can take a
**blend mask** (`weight_map texture:<name>`) that selects child 0 vs child 1 per hit.
A scalar map on `ior` remains future work.

## Procedural patterns (math-driven materials)

A `pattern "name" { … }` block compiles a **scalar field** — a function of the hit
point evaluated per shading sample — that can drive any scalar material parameter
*procedurally*, without a texture image. The variables available to a pattern are the
world-space position `x y z`, the implicit field value `f` (the SDF value at the hit,
`~0` on an isosurface; `0` for explicit geometry), the surface normal `nx ny nz`, the
radius `r = √(x²+y²+z²)`, and the **surface UV coordinates `u v`** (mesh-interpolated,
or a native-primitive wrap — see below). Two authoring forms:

- **Free-form expression** — `expr "0.5 + 0.5*sin(40*y)"` (must be quoted). Compiled by
  a shunting-yard parser to a postfix scalar VM. Supports `+ - * / ^ %`, comparison-free
  math, `pi`, and functions `abs sqrt sin cos tan exp log floor fract sign saturate min
  max atan2 step pow clamp mix smoothstep noise`.
- **Named generator** — `type <gen>` plus params (mirrors material syntax):

  | Generator | Parameters | Result |
  |---|---|---|
  | `axis`    | `axis <x\|y\|z>` `[scale]` `[offset]` | a coordinate ramp |
  | `radial`  | `[center <x y z>]` `[scale]` | distance from a point |
  | `bands`   | `axis <x\|y\|z>` `[freq]` `[phase]` | `0.5+0.5·sin(2π·freq·coord+phase)` stripes |
  | `checker` | `[size]` | 0/1 world-space checkerboard |
  | `noise`   | `[freq]` | deterministic value noise in [0,1] (CPU/GPU bit-identical) |
  | `field`   | `[scale]` | the raw implicit field value `f`, scaled |

Bind a pattern anywhere a scalar `texture:<name>` map is accepted, using
`pattern:<name>` instead: **roughness** (`dielectric`/`glossy`/preset/`layered` coat),
**film thickness** (`thinfilm`, preset), and a 2-child `mix` **`weight_map`**. The
`weight_map` case is the powerful one: because a `mix` blends whole materials, a pattern
weight makes the *material itself* — colour **and** BSDF type — vary from point to
point (checkerboard of red vs green diffuse, noise-selected metal vs glass, …). See
`scenes/procedural.ftsl`. *(GPU: patterns run on the device forward and backward
paths, including a roughness pattern on a `dielectric` (frosted glass). GPU BDPT is the
exception — its MIS kernel falls back to the CPU for any pattern or frosted/colored
glass.)*

**UV on native primitives.** The `u v` pattern variables aren't limited to meshes.
A native `sphere {}` carries built-in equirectangular (lat/long) UVs, a `quad {}`
maps its `u`/`v` edges to (0,0)→(1,1), and an `isosurface` can request a procedural
wrap with `uv planar|spherical|cylindrical [axis=x|y|z]` — the **same projection used
for un-`vt`'d meshes**, referenced to the surface's world bounds. So a checker or
stripe authored in `(u,v)` space wraps *around* the object (a globe, tiles converging
at the poles, a grid on box faces) instead of slicing through world space. See
`scenes/uv_native.ftsl`.

## Participating media / fog

`medium { sigma_t <v> albedo <v> g <v> rayleigh <bool> }`, or from the CLI with
`-fog <sigma_t> -fogalbedo <a> -fogg <g> [-fograyleigh]`. Henyey–Greenstein phase
function by default; Rayleigh optional.

**Multiple, overlapping media.** Author as many `medium` blocks as you like — they
coexist as independent regions (e.g. two differently-tinted fog orbs plus a faint
global haze). The forward tracer superposes them physically: extinction adds (total
transmittance is the *product* of the per-medium transmittances) and each scatter is
drawn from the *earliest* of the media's independent free-flights. A single-`medium`
scene is bit-identical to before.

**Bounded, heterogeneous fog (blobs).** The medium isn't limited to a single global
haze. Add `bounds { min <x y z> max <x y z> }` to confine it to an axis-aligned box —
or `bounds { center <x y z> radius <r> }` to confine it to a **sphere** region, i.e.
simple *per-object* fog like **the whole inside of a glass sphere** (author the same
center/radius as the sphere). Or shape the fog to a **named object** with
`bounds { object "<name>" }`: a named `sphere` gives its exact analytic bound, a named
`isosurface` fills the field's interior (the fog takes the metaball/SDF silhouette
exactly, carved per-point during tracking), and a named `mesh` uses the mesh's world
AABB (a box approximation; true mesh containment is deferred). An *open* fog sphere is directly viewable in every mode.
Fog inside an actual **glass shell** is *not imaged directly* by the next-event modes
`A`/`B` — an accuracy limitation, not a speed one: seeing the fog through the curved glass
is a refracted (specular↔volume) path, and the pinhole splat `B` and finite-lens splat `A`
connect the fog to the camera with a **straight** ray that the glass occludes (and could not
bend anyway), so that view renders black. The fog still correctly **lights the surrounding
room** indirectly in those modes. **BDPT `D` images fog-through-glass correctly**: its
camera subpath refracts through the shell (specular vertices) to a volume in-scatter vertex,
then MIS-connects bidirectionally to the light, so a lantern glowing inside a fogged glass
sphere renders as a bright disc rather than black. Photon-catch `C` traces the same path but
far more slowly (the fog-scattered photon must refract out and hit the pupil).
Add `density "<expr>"` (or `density pattern:<name>`) —
a scalar field over world `x y z` (the same infix expression language as isosurface
`function` fields) that scales `sigma_t` per point — for **fog blobs with soft, formula-defined
boundaries**: e.g. a smooth radial falloff `pow(saturate(1 - dist/R), 2)` renders a
glowing sphere of haze whose edge fades gradually instead of a hard surface. Sampling is
unbiased **delta (Woodcock) tracking** for scattering and **ratio tracking** for shadow
transmittance — exact, no voxelization. A majorant `density_max` is auto-estimated over
`bounds` (or set explicitly). Heterogeneous/bounded fog is honored by the **forward**
modes (A/B/C) on **both the CPU and the GPU** (the device runs the identical density VM +
delta/ratio tracking). **BDPT `D`** renders media of **every kind** — global haze,
multiple superposed media, box/sphere/object-**bounded** fog, and **heterogeneous
`density`-field blobs** — unbiased on both the CPU and the GPU: subpath medium vertices are
placed by delta tracking (analog throughput) and connection edges weighted by ratio-tracking
transmittance, exactly as the forward tracer samples them. (The MIS weights omit the
heterogeneous distance-pdf / transmittance — a variance-only simplification per PBRT-v3;
the balance heuristic is a partition of unity so the estimator stays unbiased regardless.)
The backward reference (R/V) and the P composite treat the medium as a single global homogeneous haze
and warn if you author `density`/`bounds` for them. See `FTSL.md` §12.1.

## Scene language (FTSL)

> **Full reference: [`FTSL.md`](FTSL.md)** — the complete grammar (every block, key,
> default, spectrum/pattern/material form, and parsing quirk). The overview below is a
> quick tour; `FTSL.md` is the authoritative spec.

An FTSL file is a list of blocks. Top-level block types: `scene` (the
`units …` / `spectral …` header), `material`, `texture`, `pattern` (procedural scalar
field), `spectrum`, `sphere`, `quad`, `triangle`, `mesh`, `isosurface` (implicit SDF
surface / CSG / metaballs / arbitrary `function` formulas), `light`, `group`, `medium`,
`camera`, `camera_path` (keyframed camera animation), `camera_orbit` (turntable /
fly-around: N frames on a circle around a `center`, for MP4 orbits), `camera_curve`
(spline fly-through with variable speed), and `render` (render-setting overrides). See the `scenes/` directory for worked examples
(`cornell.ftsl`, `fisheye.ftsl`, `spotlight.ftsl`, `envlight.ftsl`,
`material_presets.ftsl`, `realcam.ftsl`, `implicit.ftsl`, `function.ftsl`,
`procedural.ftsl`, `uv_native.ftsl`, `showcase_orbit.ftsl`, `translucency.ftsl`, …).

### Camera animation (`camera_path`, `camera_orbit`)

Both expand into a sequence of frames sharing look_at/up/fov/mode/film/lens; a
multi-camera render writes one file per frame (`_<name>` inserted before the
extension), which ffmpeg concatenates into a video.

- **`camera_path "name" { … key <t> <ex ey ez> [<lx ly lz>] [<fov>] … frames N }`** —
  keyframed fly-through: the eye (and optionally look_at / fov) is linearly
  interpolated across `key` frames. Optional `dolly_zoom` holds the subject's
  on-screen size (Vertigo effect); optional `exposure_lock` shares frame 0's exposure.
- **`camera_orbit "name" { center <x y z> radius <m> [height <m>] [axis x|y|z] frames N
  [start_deg <d>] [sweep_deg <d>] [look_at <x y z>] [exposure_lock] }`** — a turntable /
  fly-around whose eye rides a circle around `center` (the default look_at). The circle
  lies in the plane perpendicular to `axis` (default y); `height` offsets the eye along
  the axis. A full 360° sweep is sampled so frame N == frame 0 (seamless loop); a
  partial sweep spans its endpoints. See `scenes/showcase_orbit.ftsl` (an orbit tuned
  to fly straight *through* a glass sphere).
- **`camera_curve "name" { point <x y z> … [frames N] [density <ρ> | density_at <t> <ρ> …]
  [look tangent | look_at <x y z> | look curve + look_point <x y z> …] [closed] }`** — a
  fly-through along a **Catmull-Rom spline** that passes through the `point` control
  points. Camera placement is either a fixed `frames` count (uniform arc length) or a
  **density** (cameras per unit length) that can vary along the curve via `density_at`
  keyframes — this is the camera's *speed*: high density = many closely-spaced frames =
  slow dwell, low density = fast. Aim along the travel tangent (default), at a fixed
  `look_at`, or at a second `look curve`.

### Multi-camera shared photon pass (modes `A` and `B`)

When several cameras render at once (multiple `camera` blocks, or the frames a
`camera_path`/`orbit`/`curve` expands into) in a **forward next-event** mode, the
tracer flies **one** photon set and splats every vertex to **all** cameras of that
mode at once, instead of re-flying the photons per camera. This is the "many cameras
for one photon set" win — emission, BVH traversal, and scattering are paid once. It
runs on **both the CPU and the GPU** (`-device gpu`), and applies to the two forward
splat models:

- **`B` (pinhole splat)** — `connect()` draws no random numbers, so the shared pass is
  **bit-identical** to rendering each camera on its own.
- **`A` (finite-lens camera)** — each camera samples its own aperture pupil (draws
  RNG), so the shared photon flight is **unbiased per camera** but matches a standalone
  render **in distribution**, not bit-for-bit. Rectilinear cameras only.

The `A` and `B` cameras form **separate** shared passes (mode `A` perturbs the RNG
stream during the trace; mode `B` doesn't). Sharing applies to plain `-n` renders with
per-frame auto-exposure; exposure-locked animation paths and the budget flags
(`-time`/`-noise`/`-forever`/`-resume`/`-preview`) render per camera.

**Shared vs. independent randomness across cameras (matters for video and for
side-by-side cameras).** This is the key per-mode difference in how randomness is
distributed *between* cameras. Note that **a "frame" here is simply a camera in the same
scene**: a `camera_path`/`orbit`/`curve` expands into one `camera` per frame, and they all
render together in a single scene exactly like several hand-authored `camera` blocks — so
everything below applies identically whether you wrote the cameras out by hand or generated
them as animation frames:

- **`B`** — every camera is splatted from the *same* photon set, so they share identical
  random paths: a camera's noise is **correlated** with every other camera's (and a camera
  rendered in the group is bit-identical to rendering it alone). Across an animation the
  grain drifts coherently frame-to-frame rather than reshuffling.
- **`A`** — cameras share the photon *flight* but each draws its own aperture-pupil
  samples, so each carries **independent** randomness on top of the shared paths (unbiased
  per camera; correlated only through the shared flight).
- **`C`/`R`/`D`/`P`/`V`** — each camera is traced **fully independently** with its own
  sample budget, so their randomness (and noise) is **uncorrelated** by construction.

Mode `B`'s correlation is usually invisible (and cheaper), but if you want independent,
film-grain-like noise per camera/frame, render them separately (e.g. via a budget flag,
which falls back to per-camera passes) so each draws its own photons.

> **Other modes do NOT save time with multiple cameras.** `C` (finite-aperture catch)
> consumes each photon at the first aperture it hits, so it can't share a photon set; and
> `R`, `D`, `P`, and `V` are camera-anchored estimators that trace **from** each camera —
> a multi-camera render of those modes simply renders **each camera independently**
> (re-tracing the full sample budget per camera), so it costs the same as running them
> one at a time. Only `A` and `B` amortise the trace across cameras.

### Importing Mitsuba scenes

`tools/mitsuba_to_ftsl.py` converts a Mitsuba (0.6 / 2 / 3) XML scene to FTSL:

```
python tools/mitsuba_to_ftsl.py scene.xml scene.ftsl
ftrace -in scene.ftsl -mode D -o out.png
```

Mitsuba is also a spectral, physically-based renderer, so most constructs map
almost 1:1: the `perspective`/`thinlens` sensor → an FTSL `camera` (`thinlens`
becomes mode `A` with aperture + focus), `diffuse`/`conductor`/`roughconductor`/
`dielectric`/`plastic` BSDFs → `diffuse`/`mirror`/`glossy`/`dielectric` materials,
and `area`/`constant`/`envmap` emitters → FTSL lights. `rectangle`, `cube`,
`sphere`, and `obj` shapes are supported (with full `to_world` transforms); RGB
reflectances ride FTSL's Jakob–Hanika upsampling and measured/blackbody spectra
pass through losslessly. Constructs outside FTSL's scope (rough transmission,
bump/normal maps, `.ply`/`.serialized` meshes, mesh area-emitters) degrade to a
documented approximation and are flagged with `# WARN:` comments in the output.
Since **Blender can export directly to Mitsuba XML** (via the `mitsuba-blender`
add-on), this doubles as a Blender → FTSL path.

## Output

Images are written as **PNG** (24-bit RGB, 8 bits/channel — no alpha), **JPEG**
(q95), or binary **PPM (P6)**, chosen by the output file extension, tone-mapped from
the internal linear spectral film to 8-bit sRGB. Long renders can checkpoint to
`<out>.ftbuf` and resume deterministically.

**Converting existing artifacts to PNG** — `ftrace -topng <in> <out.png>` re-encodes
an artifact to a 24-bit PNG *without re-rendering*:

- a **`.ppm`** (binary P6, 8-bit) is copied to PNG losslessly;
- a **`.ftbuf`** resume-checkpoint has its raw linear film tone-mapped (with the
  default p99 auto-exposure — the sidecar doesn't store the exposure mode, so an
  absolute/lumens scene may read brighter or darker than its original `-o` image;
  re-render for an exposure-exact PNG).

A `.ftsl` is a *scene*, not an image — render it with `-in scene.ftsl -o out.png`.
Three drag-and-drop Windows helpers in the repo root wrap this: **`ppm_to_png.bat`**,
**`ftbuf_to_png.bat`** (both call `-topng`), and **`ftsl_to_png.bat`** (renders the
scene). Drop a file on one, or run `ppm_to_png.bat input.ppm [output.png]`.
